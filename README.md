# Bored API Wrapper and Database.
This program uses a Bored API wrapper and a database class to get a random activity and save it in a database.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can check this by opening a command prompt and entering `python --version`. If you do not have Python installed, you can download them from the official Python website.

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the cloned repository is located.

4. This program now runs only on Python 3.11 and uses only the standard Python libraries, so there is no need to install any additional dependencies and the requirements.txt file is unnecessary.

## Usage
To run the program, use the command:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

### The program has two commands: `new` and `list`.

### The `new` command gets a random activity from the Bored API using the provided filters and saves it in the database. For example:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py new --type education --participants 1 --price_min 0.1 --price_max 30 --accessibility_min 0.1 --accessibility_max 0.5
    ```
This command will run the program and get a new random activity with type education, 1 participant, price 0.1, and accessibility 0.1, then save it in the database.

### The `list` command lists the latest activities saved in the database. For example:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py list
    ```
This command will run the program and list the last 5 activities saved in the database.

## Testing
To run tests for this program, use the command in the project directory.

    ```bash
    python -m unittest -v
    ```
